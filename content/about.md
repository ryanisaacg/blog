# About Me

 I'm studing Computer Science at Rutgers University New Brunswick in the School of Arts and Sciences Honors Program. My main area of experience is PC game development, and I have had internships for both web and mobile applications. Most of my side projects are written either C, Java, Python, or Rust.

### Professional Experience

My professional experience so far is limited to internships and work in research labs. This past summer (2019) I worked as an intern at Facebook in the Connectivity organization.

### Rust Gamedev

You may know me from my work in open-source Rust game libraries. I'm the developer of [Quicksilver](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver) and I contribute to other libraries in the ecosystem like [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) and [gilrs](https://gitlab.com/gilrs-project/gilrs). My main focus is ease-of-use and web deployments, with the goal of making it zero-effort to write a game in Rust that works both natively and on the web.
