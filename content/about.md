title: "About Me"
---

I'm a computer science student and a software developer, studying Computer Science at Rutgers University New Brunswick in the School of Arts and Sciences Honors Program. My main area of experience is full stack web development, with my side projects focused on open source game development.

### Academic Experience

I'm a senior studying Computer Science at Rutgers University; I've tried to take a wide variety of upper-level classes, with an interest in improving computing accessibility.

### Professional Experience

This past summer (2019) I worked as an intern at Facebook [on the Analytics team in the Connectivity organization](https://connectivity.fb.com/analytics/), where I worked full-stack on both front-end products and the backend services to power them. On the frontend, I made improvements to tools to automate previously manual processes, and on the backend I implemented a new more resilient model to represent polygons in map data.

Since late 2018, I've worked in the [Laboratory for Computer Science Research](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/lcsr/) at Rutgers University, focusing on improving the auto-grading functionality used by our introduction-level Computer Science courses like [CS 111, Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/courses/introduction-to-computer-science). I've made small tweaks to the web app where students submit grades and worked on improving the existing grading program, as well as expanding the auto-grader to new courses.

Last year (2018) and the year before (2017) I worked at [Vydia](https://vydia.com/). In 2018, I worked largely on moving backend services from a monolithic EC2 instance to a serverless framework via AWS Lambda and Fargate, which decreased processing costs and time for critical functions like media uploads. In 2017, I was more focused on the frontend, and worked on user experience improvements like a First-Time User Interface to teach the functionality of the mobile app.

In 2016, I worked as a research assistant at Monmouth University on a project called DYNAMO, which explored dynamic ways to track moving objects in a given field. Largely we focused on bluetooth, RFID, and machine vision. My work was to mostly to turn gathered data into a viewable format, first by converting from a series of Excel files to a MongoDB database and then by creating a web app to visualize the data; the app used a small Python backend with a Typescript/jQuery frontend.

### Rust Gamedev

You may know me from my work in open-source Rust game libraries. I'm the developer of [Quicksilver](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver) (as well as related libraries), and I maintain the web backend for [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit). My main focus is ease-of-use and web deployments, with the goal of making it zero-effort to write a game in Rust that works both natively and on the web.
