## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ryan

I'm a software engineer and a hobbyist game developer.

You can find my resume and work history on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ryanisaacg).

My open-source work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/);
I sometimes talk about it [here on my blog.](TODO)

Sometimes, [I](TODO) [make](TODO) [games](TODO).

Nowadays I make tools to make games, like [Quicksilver](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver), my library for writing Rust games for desktop and the web.

If you want to get in contact, you can reach me [via email](mailto:ryan@ryanisaacg.com).
