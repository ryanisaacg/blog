## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ryan

My pronouns are he/him or they/them (no preference).
I'm a software engineer and a hobbyist game developer/writer.

You can find my resume and work history on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ryanisaacg). Currently I work on knowledge management and collaboration tools [on Workplace](https://www.workplace.com/), though I'm also interested in tools for creatives and artists, and communications platforms.

My open-source work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/);
I sometimes talk about it [here on my blog.](posts/) My focus used to be game development; I developed and maintain a game framework called [Quicksilver](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver), a library for writing Rust games for desktop and web. I've also made a handful of [small](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/rebound) [video](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/hellevator) [games](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/interplanet).

Currently I'm exploring physical games, especially table-top roleplaying games. I've published [one](https://ryanisaacg.itch.io/on-the-wrong-side-of-infinity), and I'm actively working on another.

If you want to get in contact, you can reach me [via email](mailto:ryan@ryanisaacg.com).
