## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ryan

My pronouns are they/them or he/him (no preference).
I'm a software engineer and a hobbyist game developer/writer.

Currently I work on knowledge management and collaboration tools, though I'm also interested in tools for creatives and artists.

I write [table-top roleplaying / pen and paper games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game). Head over to [my itch.io page](https://ryanisaacg.itch.io) to check out and download them!

My open-source projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/);
I sometimes talk about them [here on my blog.](posts/) My focus used to be game development; I developed and maintain a game framework called [Quicksilver](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver), a library for writing [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) games for desktop and web. I've also made a handful of [small](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/rebound) [video](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/hellevator) [games](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/interplanet).

If you want to get in contact, you can reach me [via email](mailto:ryan@ryanisaacg.com).
